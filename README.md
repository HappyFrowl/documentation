# Overview
This documentation provides an beginners guide to Linux system administration. It presupposes no knowledge of Linux systems, although it does assume you have a basic knowledge of computer systems, networking, storage, etc. The aim is to establish a firm grasp of the tools used in Linux to implement technologies concerning these topics. 
The documentation is created based on the various video courses, YouTube explanatory videos, Linux books (specifically *Unix and Linux SYstem Administration Handbook*), and the author's own experiences and lessons learned while growing in this field. 

Although it does not follow any curriculum for any certificate, the hopes are that this documentation provides enough in depth information for establishing a firm grasp on Linux system administrations for aspiring admins, and perhaps the LFCS exam. 

Even though the sections can be studies in any order, the suggestion is as follows:
- Basic Scripting
- System Administration
- Storage Management
- Networking
- Monitoring
- Security
